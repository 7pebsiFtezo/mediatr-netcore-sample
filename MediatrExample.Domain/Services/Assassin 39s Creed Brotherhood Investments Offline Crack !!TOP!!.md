Fortunately, there is a way to bypass this limitation and enjoy the benefits of investing in shops and banks without internet connection. All you need is a crack file that modifies the game's code and allows you to invest offline. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Download the crack file from [this link](https://example.com). Make sure you have a backup of your original game files before applying the crack.
2. Extract the crack file and copy the contents to your game folder, where the executable file is located. Overwrite any existing files when prompted.
3. Launch the game and load your save file. You should now be able to invest in shops and banks offline, as long as you have enough money.
4. Enjoy your improved income and discounts!

Note: This crack only works for Assassin's Creed Brotherhood version 1.03. If you have a different version of the game, you may need to find a different crack or update your game. Also, this crack may not work with some antivirus programs or online services, so use it at your own risk.
  
Investing in shops and banks in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood can be very beneficial for your gameplay. By investing in shops, you can unlock new items and weapons, as well as get discounts on purchases. By investing in banks, you can increase your income and collect money faster. Investing also helps you increase your synchronization level and unlock achievements and trophies.
 
However, investing in shops and banks requires an internet connection, which can be inconvenient for some players who prefer to play offline or have a slow or unstable connection. This is because the game uses an online service called Uplay to track your investments and synchronize them with the game's servers. Without an internet connection, you cannot access Uplay or invest in shops and banks.
 
This is where the crack file comes in handy. By applying the crack file to your game folder, you can modify the game's code and bypass the Uplay requirement. This way, you can invest in shops and banks offline, without needing an internet connection. The crack file also fixes some bugs and glitches that may occur when playing offline.
  
To use the crack file, you need to have Assassin's Creed Brotherhood version 1.03 installed on your computer. You can check your game version by looking at the bottom right corner of the main menu screen. If you have a different version of the game, you may need to update it or find a different crack file that matches your version.

You also need to have a backup of your original game files before applying the crack file. This is because the crack file will overwrite some of the game files and may cause problems if you want to play online or restore your game to its original state. To make a backup, simply copy your game folder to a different location on your computer or an external drive.
 
Once you have downloaded and extracted the crack file, you can copy its contents to your game folder, where the executable file is located. You may need to grant administrator permissions or disable your antivirus program to do this. When prompted, overwrite any existing files with the crack files. Then, launch the game and load your save file. You should now be able to invest in shops and banks offline.
