ArcGIS 10.1 License Manager is a software that allows you to manage the concurrent use licenses for ArcGIS Desktop and other ArcGIS products. You can install ArcGIS 10.1 License Manager on a machine where ArcGIS Concurrent Use versions will be run or on a machine where only the license manager will be installed. Other ArcGIS installations will define that license manager after the installation process.
 
To install and authorize your license manager, you will need to use the authorization information that you received by email from Esri Customer Service when you purchased your product. You will also need to have TCP/IP installed and functioning properly on your Windows license server.
